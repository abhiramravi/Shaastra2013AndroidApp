    <string name="hopsi_intro">On behalf of the entire Shaastra team, we would like to extend a warm welcome to you and hope that you cherish each and every moment of your stay at the beautiful campus of IIT Madras. Shaastra, the annual technical festival of IIT Madras, is undeniably one of the largest technical festivals of India having achieved huge feats with unparalleled figures ever since its inception in 2000. It provides a unique platform for young minds to stretch their imaginations to the limit and exhibit their skills across a multitude of technically challenging, arduous and thought provoking events traversing all fields of engineering. A festival of this magnitude naturally implies a humungous turn up of participants. We, the Hospitality team at Shaastra have pledged to leave no stone unturned to ensure that your stay with us is enjoyable and comfortable. Hospitality of the guests is of paramount importance to us.

IIT Madras is commonly referred to as ‘Land of stationary rivers and moving mountains’ thanks to the hostel names, based on Indian rivers. It is situated on Sardar Patel Road and is flanked by Adyar, Taramani and Velachery. The campus is opposite to the Central Leather Research Institute and Anna University and is spread over 630 acres of lush green forest. One could go on a bird-watching spree and spot exotic species nesting in the forest cover. Be it the lush-green Chemplast Cricket stadium or the extensive grazing grounds for the deer in the campus or the magnificent lake in the forest, the campus could well be a destination for all you nature-lovers out there!

Hope to see you here at Shaastra 2013. We will be more than happy to be able to address your suggestions and queries.</string>
